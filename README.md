# BEFORE:
### ★ Added New Column with Formula:
>**=MID(D7,5,1)**  
>Returns exact the last character of the 5-digit zip code string (and if the zip code does not have 5 characters, then it returns nothing – which is good to double check any errors as to why there is not a 5-digit zip code)  
  
### ★ “Froze” the top six panes  
>I froze them so that data can sort without sorting the column headers.  
>Sorted this new column of last digits, 0-9, and then non-numbers at the bottom.  
  
### ★ Filtered the data by new column so that only “3” entries showed – then deleted all.  
>Repeated filtering and deleting for 5 and 7 as well.  
  
### ★ Added Another New Column with Formula:  
>**=ISNUMBER(SEARCH("foreign",F7))**  
>This checks to see which schools are “foreign” institutions.
